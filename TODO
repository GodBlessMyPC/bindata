* Add a way to do something like: read a bunch of integers and stop reading
  after reading an integer with a value of 0.

* Add scoping so the value of a param doesn't need to call parent

* Maybe add an endian method to struct so you can say int16 instead of int16le.
  - Should this by lazily evaluated, or evaluated only once when
    instantiating fields?

* Think how offset_of should work.
